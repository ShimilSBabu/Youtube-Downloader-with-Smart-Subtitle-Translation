# Youtube-Downloader-with-Smart-Subtitle-Translation
When the video URL is given as input, this program;

  1) Downloads the video.
  2) Searches for presence of hard/soft subtitles.
  3) Reads the subtitles from images for hard-encoded subtitles.
  4) Translates the subtitles into the user's preferred language.
  5) Generates .srt file containing the translated subtitles and timestamps.
  6) Downloads the subtitle file with the same name as the video, so that the subtitle automatically loads when the video is played.
